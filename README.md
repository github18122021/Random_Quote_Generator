# Random Quote Generator

This is a simple web application built using React.js and powered by the Random Quote Generator API from RapidAPI. The application generates random quotes with the click of a button and displays them to the user.

## Features

- **Random Quote Generation**: Clicking the "Generate" button fetches a random quote from the API and displays it to the user.
- **Error Handling**: Handles errors gracefully and displays error messages if there's an issue fetching the quote.
- **Loading State**: Displays a loading message while fetching the quote to provide feedback to the user.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: Utilized for building the user interface and managing state.
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Used for data fetching and caching with ease.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the Random Quote Generator API.
- **RapidAPI**: Provides access to various APIs, including the Random Quote Generator API used in this project.
